##My Changelog Narrative PLUS TODOS
Building repo from TUTO!!

We have npm init -y

*just because*
- we have dependencies, put that in here(package.json)
- npm installs for our project folder
- scripts in here to help us with the webpack, to run and build "the site"

We have npm install --save-dev express webpack webpack-dev-server

*just because*
- need the small server so we can do this locally in node_modules

prod means actually live application
webpack.config.dev
webpack.config.prod screencast@@3.39

webpack.config.dev  creating our webpack configuration
'eval' is decided to use for our sourcemaps for debugging
- def 'entry' where will it be found
- def filename 'bundle.js'
- def 'public' path (static)
